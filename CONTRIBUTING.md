# Contributing to Azurite
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github, Trello, and Discord
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
We use Trello to track development tasks.
We use Discord for communication.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
3. Document all code that you write using javadocs.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://github.com/Games-With-Gabe-Community/Azurite/blob/main/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Games-With-Gabe-Community/Azurite/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
  - Including error logs if applicable
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Until we develop a less verbose coding style, please follow the [Google Java code guidelines](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) 
It is important to keep the style consistent across the codebase so that other contributors can read your code.

* 4 space tabs
* descriptive variable and class naming
* appropriate use of getters and setters
* javadocs where appropriate (ie. on public methods, variables and classes)
